Released as 0.79.

Wed Nov 26 00:57:12 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/UDP.pm: Added localisation of $! around undef'ing $self
 	to preserve the errno value in the ->new method.

	* lib/Net/TCP.pm: Added localisation of $! around undef'ing $self
 	to preserve the errno value in the ->new method.

	* lib/Net/Inet.pm: Added localisation of $! around undef'ing $self
 	to preserve the errno value in the ->new method.

	* lib/Net/UNIX.pm: Fixed 'type' param initialisation so that
	the 'new' routine doesn't return undef because ->open failed.
	Added localisation of $! around undef'ing $self to preserve
	the errno value in the ->new and ->init methods.

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Added ->isconnecting method, and added timeouts
 	and the blocking object parameter.  Added localisation of $!
  	around undef'ing $self to preserve the errno value in the ->new
 	and ->init methods.  Tweaked STORE method to avoid passing undef
 	to ->put.

Tue Nov 25 00:24:59 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Gen.xs: Added socket-related errno values to the Net::Gen UV
 	constant definitions.

	* Makefile.PL: Added socket-related errno values to be defaulted
 	to 0 if not present in sys/errno.h or net/errno.h.

	* lib/Net/TCP.pm: Made server-new set the reuseaddr parameter.

	* lib/Net/UNIX.pm: Cleaned up some interpolations of undef for -w.
	Made server-new set the reuseaddr parameter.

	* lib/Net/UDP.pm: Slight doc tweak.

	* lib/Net/Inet.pm: Cleaned up some interpolations of undef for -w.

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Added reuseaddr param key.  Added :errnos tag
 	for socket-related errno values, and added those errnos to
 	@EXPORT_OK.

Mon Nov 24 23:39:23 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Cleaned up some interpolations of undef for -w.
  	Fixed some doc typos.

Released as 0.78.

Mon Jul 14 21:28:00 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* README: Pointed harder at Makefile.PL for instructions about
	adding new system headers.

	* Makefile.PL: Added check for netinet/ip_tcp.h as contributed by
	Christopher F. Miller <cfm@maine.com>.  Added additional text
	near "my @hfiles" describing what a user might need to do in
	order to get a good build on a "new port".  Added perl version
	check here to keep people from trying to compile under 5.003 despite
	what the README says.

Mon May 19 05:22:54 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Makefile.PL: Added check for <netinet/in_system.h>.

Sun May 18 04:49:17 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/Inet.pm: Updated to require 5.00399 and use __PACKAGE__
        for $myclass setup.  Added 'desthost=>"host:port(n)"' handling.
        Added default ports for services known from IANA's list.

Sat May 17 20:27:23 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Updated pods.  Most significant change was to
	re-arrange the routines to be listed alphabetically, since there
	are so many of them.  Added a 'functional grouping' intro to the
	'public methods' section.  Made SEND autoloaded.  Updated to
	require 5.00399 because of TIEHANDLE support.  Because of being
	post-5.00394, switched from godawful caller()-abuse to __PACKAGE__
	for $myclass initialisation.

Fri May 16 01:01:10 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Tweak pod entry for PRINTF to avoid bogus
        warning from pod2man.

Fri May  2 14:12:54 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm (READLINE): Fixread READLINE vs. getline so
	that READLINE respects wantarray as the tied-fh internals
	expect.  Updated pods for tied-fh methods.

Thu May  1 02:14:14 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Some additional support for tied filehandles.
	Now have TIEHANDLE, READ, PRINTF, and GETC.  READLINE is still
	scalar-context-only, and these new methods need docs.

Wed Apr 30 21:11:15 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm (sub listen): Applied patch from Eric Anderson
	<eanders@cs.berkeley.edu> to eliminate warning with respect to
	$$self{didlisten} (quotes got added).

Released as version 0.77 as this part of development now seems stable.

Sat Apr  5 01:58:20 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* README: Added a copyright statement as per the recommendations
        in the module list.

	* lib/Net/Inet.pm: Missed INADDR_UNSPEC_GROUP before.

	* Gen.xs: Consolidated the BOOT: sections for better compilation
        performance.

Fri Apr  4 12:47:18 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Makefile.PL: Added MY::libscan to keep my local 'make install'
        working despite my backup files.

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Fixed up the RECV method so that its calling
	sequence is appropriate for tied FH support, instead of matching
	the recv method.  Updated the pod accordingly.

	* lib/Net/UDP.pm: Updated the new/init handling to set IPproto as
	well as proto (just in case).

	* lib/Net/UNIX.pm: Updated the bind and connect methods to allow
	additional parameter setting, as in Inet.pm.  Updated the pods to
	match.

	* lib/Net/TCP.pm: Slight pod cleanup.

	* lib/Net/Inet.pm: Updated general pod for the IN_MULTICAST() and
	IPOPT_COPIED() additions, along with the IP multicast addresses.

	* README: Updated for items which are (mostly?) done.

Limited private release as 0.76 with these changes except for the ChangeLog.

Fri Apr  4 12:28:57 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/UNIX.pm: Updated EXPORT_TAGS and related pod.

	* lib/Net/TCP.pm: Updated EXPORT_TAGS and related pod.

	* lib/Net/Inet.pm: Updated EXPORT_TAGS and related pod.

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Updated EXPORT_TAGS and related pod.  Changed
	initsockopts to use a generated closure in the caller's package to
	evaluate the proposed socket options.  I'm not convinced whether
	this is better than the previous can() method, though.  Some
	profiling is required, along with testing the behaviour of each
	style under pathological conditions.

	* Gen.xs: Removed entries in constant() which will (now) never be
        missing from the rest of the generated file.  Added entries for
        the 1-arg macros, and a few new constants (such as IPOPT_CIPSO and
        INADDR_ALLRTRS_GROUP).  Added support for sv_inaddr_t / T_INADDR
        typemap (routine sv2inaddr) so that IN_CLASSD() and friends can
        take a local-byte-ordered UV or a PV which is returned by
        Socket::inet_aton() or unpack_sockaddr_in() which is in network
        byte order.

	* Makefile.PL: Added code to create "netgen.h" for #include, in
        support of finding local .h files and generating default values
        for system-independent symbols.  This means that I have #defines
        which duplicate the anonymous enums used in Linux, but that's
        life.  The macros generated in netgen.h allow me to support some
        of the 1-argument macros, too, such as IN_CLASSD() and
        IPOPT_COPIED().

	* typemap: Add sv_inaddr_t / T_INADDR mapping for the new
        IN_CLASSD() and related predicate functions.

Released as version 0.75 (still alpha) because of perl 5.003_96 & AUTOLOAD.

Tue Apr  1 00:53:05 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* README: Add a note about the Linux issue, and configuration
	problems with tracking down the right <*.h> files.

	* lib/Net/UNIX.pm: Hoisted initialisation, and corrected for the
        non-inherited AUTOLOAD problem.  Minor additional cleanup so that
        it will work with autosplit now.

	* lib/Net/UDP.pm: Hoisted initialisation, and corrected for the
        non-inherited AUTOLOAD problem.

	* lib/Net/Inet.pm: Hoisted initialisation, and corrected for the
	non-inherited AUTOLOAD problem.  Made auto-split, as well.

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Hoisted some things into BEGIN {} blocks so that
	should-be-constant subs (and xsubs) will be.

	* Gen.xs (cv_constant): Fixed up the constant XSUBs.  Now they
	really are.

Sun Mar 30 20:34:35 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Revamped a lot of calling sequences to be a
	strict match for the docs, after cleaning up the few remaining
	errant calls in my own code.  This streamlined a lot of the
	methods, so some fairly common operations should be faster now.
	Also fixed up references to $myclass so that the "should be
	autoloaded" functions can be.  In fact, now they are.  Added the
	condition() method, so that the autoflush() and binmode() calls in
	accept() and open() can be abstracted.  Some sub-classes may only
	need to override (or augment) condition() now rather than both
	open() and accept().

Turned loose as version 0.74 (still alpha because of the Linux problem).

Fri Mar 28 21:48:53 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Gen.xs: Revamp `constant' subs for easier auto-generation.
	Still to do: mark them as constant.

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Fix up eof handling in get().  Fix up
	subclass new() call in accept().  Eliminate private gensym
	emulation and just use Symbol::gensym().  Document the new
	ckeof() method.

Thu Mar 27 02:12:41 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Declare missing constant routines so that they
	have the right prototypes.

	* lib/Net/TCP.pm: Declare routines which need to go through
	constant() so that they always have the same prototype.

	* Gen.xs (constant): Create routines for the constants which are
        defined, so that we only call constant() in the AUTOLOAD routine
        for missing macros.

Tue Mar 25 11:50:01 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* README: Updated.

	* lib/Net/UNIX.pm: Finished the promised routines in the pod.
	Cleaned up for new distribution structure.

	* lib/Net/UDP.pm: Clean up for new distribution structure.
	Query--Does this module need a Server sub-class like the TCP one?

	* lib/Net/TCP.pm: Clean up for inherited autoloader.  Some pod
        updates.

	* lib/Net/Inet.pm: Add exporter tags.  Fix up to use more of the
        routines which are in Socket (and which work well enough for me
        now).  Significant pod updates.  In _setport, allow port/service
        args like 'http(80)' for parity with IO::Socket.  In getsockinfo,
        update the lcl* parameters if we have a binding, even if the
        remote info is not available because we're not connected.

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Fix paragraph-mode mismatch in getline().  Make
	DESTROY() be null, since de-refs will do the right thing more
	efficiently than the explicit Perl code which used to be there.
	Significant pod updates.

	* Gen.xs: Eliminate 'privatized' versions of things in Socket.
        I'm cleaning up the alternate versions now that Socket works.

	* Makefile.PL: Restructure distribution layout to be friendly to
        CPAN.pm.  This also eliminates all the .xs files except for
        Gen.xs, which now has all the constants.  This makes for only one
        loadable library, which should be more efficient.  The Net::Dnet
        module has been split out into a separate distribution.

This was 'released' as version 0.72 (a.k.a alpha 8).

Sun Dec 22 09:58:02 1996  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Snapshot work-in-progress, even though should be updated
	for 5.003_13, since I'll be away for a while.

Wed Jul 24 03:29:13 1996  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Dnet/Dnet.pm: Clean up some {'word'} and {'key'=>val} stuff.

	* TCP/TCP.pm: Clean up some {'word'} and {'key'=>val} stuff.

	* Inet/Inet.pm: Clean up some {'word'} and {'key'=>val} stuff.

	* Gen/Gen.pm: Clean up some {'word'} and {'key'=>val} stuff.

Tue Jul 23 10:52:38 1996  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Contents: Remove pad_lexicals patch, since that fix is obsolete
        with 5.003.

Sun Jul 21 02:48:39 1996  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Gen/Gen.pm: Fix old bug with OOB messages and 'lastFrom'
        handling with respect to recv.

Sat Jul 20 19:32:15 1996  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Gen/Gen.pm: Begin updating for 5.003 language features (like
        SUPER:: and anonymous globs.)

	* UNIX/UNIX.pm: Begin updating for 5.003 language features (like
        SUPER:: and anonymous globs.)

	* Dnet/Dnet.pm: Begin updating for 5.003 language features (like
        SUPER:: and anonymous globs.)

	* Inet/Inet.pm: Begin updating for 5.003 language features (like
        SUPER:: and anonymous globs.)

	* UDP/UDP.pm: Begin updating for 5.003 language features (like
        SUPER:: and anonymous globs.)

Sun Jul 14 14:33:07 1996  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* TCP/TCP.pm: Fixed bug formerly patched in private testing kits
        which prevented passing parameters to Net::TCP::Server::new and
        having them take effect.
	Begin updating for 5.003 language features (like SUPER:: and
        anonymous globs.)

	* Dnet/Makefile.PL: Upgraded to MakeMaker 5.34.

	* UNIX/Makefile.PL: Upgraded to MakeMaker 5.34.

	* UDP/Makefile.PL: Upgraded to MakeMaker 5.34.

	* TCP/Makefile.PL: Upgraded to MakeMaker 5.34.

	* Inet/Makefile.PL: Upgraded to MakeMaker 5.34.

	* Gen/Makefile.PL: Upgraded to MakeMaker 5.34.

Thu Jun  1 03:38:49 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Inet/Inet.xs: Added _inet_aton() for performance.

	* Inet/Inet.pm: Moved some of inet_aton() into XSUB for
	  performance.

	* TCP/TCP.pm: Worked up Net::TCP::Server sub-module for easier
	  server creation.

Sun May 28 18:35:42 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Gen/Gen.pm: -w fixup in getline for (undef $/) case.
	  Add aliases for registerOptions and similar mixed-case methods
	  to allow names like "register_options" for those who prefer that.
	  Updated the pod for the alias methods and a discussion of the use
	  of the fileno method and/or the embedded filehandle.
	  Added new_from_fh method and pod info.

Sat May 27 02:30:46 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* TCP/TCP.pm: 'use strict' fix for select() in accept method.

Mon Apr 17 02:58:40 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* version 0.51-alpha released.

Mon Apr 10 17:45:29 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Contents: Changed to unpack into Net/ rather than ext/Net/, to
	  be friendlier to people who are building this stuff as loadable
	  pieces separate from the Perl distribution.

	* Gen/Gen.pm: More -w fixups (missed by perl -wc).

Sat Apr  8 11:26:48 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* UDP/Makefile.PL: Hack up to be in the same directory tree,
	  even though it doesn't have a .xs file.

	* UDP/UDP.pm: Make ready for exposure to the world.

	* Inet/Inet.pm: Add wrapper for pack_sockaddr_in to make
	  the 'family' argument optional.

	* Inet/Inet.xs: Fix constant() to be U32 rather than double.
	  Privatize pack_sockaddr_in() to allow for optional sin_family.

	* TCP/TCP.xs: Fix constant() to be U32 rather than double.

Wed Apr  5 14:55:54 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* TCP/TCP.pm: Remove TIESCALAR workaround, as either my
	  pad-lexicals patch fixed it or I'm no longer exercising the bug.

	* Inet/Inet.pm: Fix glitches with -w stuff.  Fix inet_aton not to
	  'use integer', as it loses the high-order bit.

	* Gen/Gen.pm: Fix glitches in the 'use strict' and -w stuff.

Mon Apr  3 02:22:21 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Version 0.50-alpha released.

Mon Apr  3 02:00:25 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* README: Updated to reflect the need for a patched 5.001.

	* Contents: add pad-lexicals-patch for making 5.001 work for me.

	* TCP/TCP.pm: Undocument ``setdebug''.  It's a botch that's only
	  there because it helped me in figuring out where things were
	  dying while looking for bugs in perl itself.  It's not a
	  desirable feature for the modules.  Debug options should be
	  per-object if they exist.

	* Gen/Gen.pm: Finish fixing up for ``use strict'' where possible
	  after my posted patches for bugs found along the way.  Enough of
	  this now depends on working lexicals that it now requires 5.001
	  (with patches) to work.

Sat Apr  1 01:07:35 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Gen/Gen.pm: Clean up for ``use strict'' and ``-w'' stuff.

	* Inet/Inet.pm: Clean up for ``use strict'' stuff.

	* TCP/TCP.pm: Clean up to make 'use strict qw(subs refs)' work.
	  Add 'use strict;' after AUTOLOAD.

Thu Mar 30 02:04:14 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* TCP/TCP.pm: Clean up -w warnings resulting from @ISA conflicts
	  between DynaLoader and AutoLoader.

	* Inet/Inet.pm: Clean up -w warnings resulting from @ISA conflicts
	  between DynaLoader and AutoLoader.

	* Gen/Gen.pm: Cleaned up a lot of warnings (-w).  Most of them
	  were "cleaned up" by being suppressed, since the overhead of
	  checking things in setparams to satisfy -w isn't really worth
	  it.  However, some of them were real, and worth fixing.

Mon Mar 27 01:51:58 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Gen/Gen.pm: Fixed the pod a bit.

	* Inet/Inet.pm: Fixed format_addr to allow static-style calls as
	  per its documentation.

	* TCP/TCP.pm: Fixed a warning-causing typo, and fixed the pod a
	  bit.  Added _addrinfo hack for format_addr.

Sat Mar 25 11:34:26 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Version 0.3-alpha released.

Sat Mar 25 11:34:26 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Inet/Inet.pm: Moved IPVERSION to @EXPORT_OK.  Added format_addr.
	  Cleaned up some sign-extension problems.
	  Added keys {lcl,rem}{host,addr,service,port} and augmented
	  getsockinfo method to fill in the values.
	  Added key IPproto to store the name of protocol in use, and
	  made keys IPproto and proto inter-dependent.

	* Gen/Gen.pm: Don't allow getline's stashed buffer to interfere
	  with recv's involving MSG_OOB.  Clean up another eval to be more
	  efficient (compiled, not purely interpreted).  Clean up some
	  sign-extension problems.

	  Added format_addr, format_local_addr, format_remote_addr
	  methods.

Fri Mar 24 02:19:09 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Gen/Gen.pm: Avoided some excessive warnings.
	  Added some error-checking to select and fhvec methods.

	* Inet/Inet.pm: Cleaned up some excess evals.

	* Inet/Inet.xs: Made {un,}pack_sockaddr_in more robust by using
	  SV* arguments and range-checking their lengths.

Tue Mar 21 16:25:33 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Version 0.2-alpha released.

Tue Mar 21 16:25:33 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Gen/Gen.pm: Added methods fhvec, select, ioctl, fcntl.

Sun Mar 19 18:31:28 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* TCP/TCP.pm: Fix workaround for TIESCALAR on first ->new() to
	  include v5.001.
	  Fix constant() handling to avoid the 'has args' problem.

	* Inet/Inet.pm: Fix to include & on calls to our own constants,
	  since they're not known as subroutines in our own module.
	  Fix constant() handling to avoid the 'has args' problem.

Revision history prior to 0.1-alpha is lost.
