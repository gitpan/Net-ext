What it is:

	Modules Net::Gen, Net::Inet, Net::TCP, Net::UDP, Net::UNIX,
	Net::TCP::Server, and Net::UNIX::Server.
	Net::Gen is not a good name, I know that, but what's in it
	really belongs in Socket, I think.  In any case, I'm open to
	votes for a better name.  Well, I would be, but it's appeared in
	a Perl Resource Kit from O'Reilly & Associates, so maybe it's
	pretty well cast in stone after all now.  C'est la guerre.

What's different from other offerings:

	Layering keeps PF_INET things in Inet, and only socket-generic
	stuff is in Gen.

	Friendly {g,s}etsockopt.

	A TIESCALAR interface for really simple socket communications.

	Properly handles connects to hosts with multiple addresses as
	long as gethostbyname() returns more than one address.  (See RFC
	1123.)

	Has had testing on threaded perls, and works as well with threads
	as perl itself (which isn't saying much, yet, given the experimental
	status of threads in Perl, but that's the limit of resolution for
	the testing).

What's still missing:

	Support for non-blocking sockets is under-tested at best.  The
	select, fhvec, ioctl, and fcntl methods aren't necessarily all
	one would wish.

	A proper set of regression & verification tests [partial].

	Proper handling of timeout options [partial].  Timed connect() and
	accept() seem to be working now, but there's no direct support
	for, say, sending as much of a block of data as possible in a
	given timeout period.

	Configuration testing to get the include files right on more
	systems, and to manage to find the constants which at least some
	Linux systems have as enums rather than as #defines.  (I think I
	have this one covered now, but that isn't proved yet.)  Other
	UNIX variants may need tweaking, and I've no idea whether it'll
	work on Win32 Perl.  Also, the non-blocking/timed connect() support
	won't work with SOCKSified perl.

	Better support (besides the plethora of protocol constants) for
	raw socket communications (required for the ICMP values to be
	useful).

	Probably several other things I won't have missed (yet).


The .pm files themselves are pod-ified (somewhat), with a catalogue of
the methods.

I'm not a technical writer, nor do I usually play one on the net.
The documentation could still use a lot of work, I'm sure.

Making it all work requires perl 5.004_04 or later.  (There are features
which are new to 5.004_05 and even 5.005 which are used, but there
are backward compatibility hooks to keep it working with 5.004_04.)

A simple test script:

	#!/usr/bin/perl

	use Net::TCP;

	$f = new Net::TCP 0, 'finger';
	die "Can't establish finger socket: $!\n" unless $f;

	put $f "-s\015\012";
	$f->shutdown(1);
	print $line while defined($line = getline $f);
	undef $f;

	die "Can't tie to finger socket: $!\n" unless
		tie $f,'Net::TCP',0,'finger';

	$f = "-s\n";
	print $line while defined($line=$f);
	untie $f;

Should be the same (on most BSD-ish systems, anyway) as
	finger ; finger
to the shell.


Anyway, bug reports & feature requests to me (spidb@cpan.org).
HOWEVER, if you have compilation difficulties, check the Makefile.PL
file again, especially near "my @hfiles".  The list of required system
include files is almost entirely tester-contributed.  If it doesn't
build (yet) on your system/configuration/version, see if you can figure
out why, following the guidelines just above "my @hfiles" there.  Future
users will thank you, too.

If you do need to send a bug report, be sure to include the output from
a `perl -V' command.  If the failure is during the test suite, also include
the output from `make test TEST_VERBOSE=1'.

Finally, previous releases of this code had a significantly different
internal implementation, which was slower (but worked in earlier versions
of perl5 than this code ever could have).  If you were using the internals
of the implementation rather than sticking to the documented interfaces,
you will have some work to do before your derived classes will work again.
