Tue Jul 23 10:52:38 1996  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

Thu Jun  1 03:38:49 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Inet/Inet.xs: Added _inet_aton() for performance.

	* Inet/Inet.pm: Moved some of inet_aton() into XSUB for
	  performance.

	* TCP/TCP.pm: Worked up Net::TCP::Server sub-module for easier
	  server creation.

Sun May 28 18:35:42 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Gen/Gen.pm: -w fixup in getline for (undef $/) case.
	  Add aliases for registerOptions and similar mixed-case methods
	  to allow names like "register_options" for those who prefer that.
	  Updated the pod for the alias methods and a discussion of the use
	  of the fileno method and/or the embedded filehandle.
	  Added new_from_fh method and pod info.

Sat May 27 02:30:46 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* TCP/TCP.pm: 'use strict' fix for select() in accept method.

Mon Apr 17 02:58:40 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* version 0.51-alpha released.

Mon Apr 10 17:45:29 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Contents: Changed to unpack into Net/ rather than ext/Net/, to
	  be friendlier to people who are building this stuff as loadable
	  pieces separate from the Perl distribution.

	* Gen/Gen.pm: More -w fixups (missed by perl -wc).

Sat Apr  8 11:26:48 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* UDP/Makefile.PL: Hack up to be in the same directory tree,
	  even though it doesn't have a .xs file.

	* UDP/UDP.pm: Make ready for exposure to the world.

	* Inet/Inet.pm: Add wrapper for pack_sockaddr_in to make
	  the 'family' argument optional.

	* Inet/Inet.xs: Fix constant() to be U32 rather than double.
	  Privatize pack_sockaddr_in() to allow for optional sin_family.

	* TCP/TCP.xs: Fix constant() to be U32 rather than double.

Wed Apr  5 14:55:54 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* TCP/TCP.pm: Remove TIESCALAR workaround, as either my
	  pad-lexicals patch fixed it or I'm no longer exercising the bug.

	* Inet/Inet.pm: Fix glitches with -w stuff.  Fix inet_aton not to
	  'use integer', as it loses the high-order bit.

	* Gen/Gen.pm: Fix glitches in the 'use strict' and -w stuff.

Mon Apr  3 02:22:21 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Version 0.50-alpha released.

Mon Apr  3 02:00:25 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* README: Updated to reflect the need for a patched 5.001.

	* Contents: add pad-lexicals-patch for making 5.001 work for me.

	* TCP/TCP.pm: Undocument ``setdebug''.  It's a botch that's only
	  there because it helped me in figuring out where things were
	  dying while looking for bugs in perl itself.  It's not a
	  desirable feature for the modules.  Debug options should be
	  per-object if they exist.

	* Gen/Gen.pm: Finish fixing up for ``use strict'' where possible
	  after my posted patches for bugs found along the way.  Enough of
	  this now depends on working lexicals that it now requires 5.001
	  (with patches) to work.

Sat Apr  1 01:07:35 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Gen/Gen.pm: Clean up for ``use strict'' and ``-w'' stuff.

	* Inet/Inet.pm: Clean up for ``use strict'' stuff.

	* TCP/TCP.pm: Clean up to make 'use strict qw(subs refs)' work.
	  Add 'use strict;' after AUTOLOAD.

Thu Mar 30 02:04:14 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* TCP/TCP.pm: Clean up -w warnings resulting from @ISA conflicts
	  between DynaLoader and AutoLoader.

	* Inet/Inet.pm: Clean up -w warnings resulting from @ISA conflicts
	  between DynaLoader and AutoLoader.

	* Gen/Gen.pm: Cleaned up a lot of warnings (-w).  Most of them
	  were "cleaned up" by being suppressed, since the overhead of
	  checking things in setparams to satisfy -w isn't really worth
	  it.  However, some of them were real, and worth fixing.

Mon Mar 27 01:51:58 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Gen/Gen.pm: Fixed the pod a bit.

	* Inet/Inet.pm: Fixed format_addr to allow static-style calls as
	  per its documentation.

	* TCP/TCP.pm: Fixed a warning-causing typo, and fixed the pod a
	  bit.  Added _addrinfo hack for format_addr.

Sat Mar 25 11:34:26 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Version 0.3-alpha released.

Sat Mar 25 11:34:26 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Inet/Inet.pm: Moved IPVERSION to @EXPORT_OK.  Added format_addr.
	  Cleaned up some sign-extension problems.
	  Added keys {lcl,rem}{host,addr,service,port} and augmented
	  getsockinfo method to fill in the values.
	  Added key IPproto to store the name of protocol in use, and
	  made keys IPproto and proto inter-dependent.

	* Gen/Gen.pm: Don't allow getline's stashed buffer to interfere
	  with recv's involving MSG_OOB.  Clean up another eval to be more
	  efficient (compiled, not purely interpreted).  Clean up some
	  sign-extension problems.

	  Added format_addr, format_local_addr, format_remote_addr
	  methods.

Fri Mar 24 02:19:09 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Gen/Gen.pm: Avoided some excessive warnings.
	  Added some error-checking to select and fhvec methods.

	* Inet/Inet.pm: Cleaned up some excess evals.

	* Inet/Inet.xs: Made {un,}pack_sockaddr_in more robust by using
	  SV* arguments and range-checking their lengths.

Tue Mar 21 16:25:33 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Version 0.2-alpha released.

Tue Mar 21 16:25:33 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Gen/Gen.pm: Added methods fhvec, select, ioctl, fcntl.

Sun Mar 19 18:31:28 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* TCP/TCP.pm: Fix workaround for TIESCALAR on first ->new() to
	  include v5.001.
	  Fix constant() handling to avoid the 'has args' problem.

	* Inet/Inet.pm: Fix to include & on calls to our own constants,
	  since they're not known as subroutines in our own module.
	  Fix constant() handling to avoid the 'has args' problem.

Revision history prior to 0.1-alpha is lost.
